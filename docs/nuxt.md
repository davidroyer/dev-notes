# Nuxt.js

## Auth Notes

`nuxt-identity-demo` is best working example I think so far

### Part 1 - Handling Already Logged In Users

You need a client-init plugin that checks for a user that has already logged in.

With using Netlify's gotrue-js library, it's as simple as getting the `currentUser` via a method.
If you weren't using something that provided this built-in functionality, you'd do something like checking in `localStorage`

Either way, once we get the result of whether there is an already logged-in user, we update our `state`.

### Part 2 - Handling Protected Routes

Need to log issue with dev not working exacftly right but works perfectly in production once the site has been statically generated.

### Part 3 - The NEW Solution Of Dynamically Setting The **Admin** To SPA

Implemented with `serverMiddleware`. Apparently this still works for SSites.
